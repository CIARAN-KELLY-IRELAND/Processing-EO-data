# Processing-EO-data
Generating timeseries and statistics from EO data

This example will utilise a file from EUMETSAT CM SAF. We will work with a NetCDF file of monthly Direct Normalized Irradiance over Germany for the 30 year period 1983 to 2012 from the Climate Data Record SARAH 2.1. This data file should be provided along with this script and is called DNI_1983-01-01-2012-12-01.nc. Put this data file in the same folder as this script is in.
